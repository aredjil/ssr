# Sample Space Reducing Process 
## Standard Sample Space Reducing Process

Sample space reducing process (SSR) is a stochastic process defined by a shrinking sample space. An object of the SSR starts at the highest state $i=N$, then with probability $Pr(i \rightarrow j)$ it jumps to any of the lower states $j \in \{1, \dots, N-1\}$. The only rule is that at any state the object is only allowed to jump to lower states, backward jumps are forbiden. Once the element reaches the lowest state $1$ the process either stops or restarts.
